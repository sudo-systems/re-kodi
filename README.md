# ReKodi
A cross platform desktop remote for Kodi/Xbmc build on Githubs awsome Electron framework, some great open source node.js libraries, AngularJS and many more great tools and libraries.

The application is far from finished (lots of stuff isn't working or buggy) but for the courageous a snapshot can be previewed by downloading the [appropriate installer](https://github.com/sudo-systems/rekodi/tree/master/installers)

Let me know what you think @ bram@sudo-systems.com or in the [issues section](https://github.com/sudo-systems/rekodi/issues)!

More information and screenshots will follow soon...
